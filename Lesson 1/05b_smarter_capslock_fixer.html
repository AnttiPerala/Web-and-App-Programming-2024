/* 
Understanding the Regex Pattern /(^\s*|[.!?]\s+)([a-z])/g
This regex is designed to find lowercase letters that need to be capitalized in a sentence.

1. (^\s*|[.!?]\s+)
This part captures the "prefix" before a lowercase letter that should be capitalized.

^ → Matches the beginning of the string.
\s* → Matches any number of spaces at the start of the string. This ensures the first word is properly capitalized, even if there are leading spaces.
| → Acts as an "or" operator, meaning we can match either:
The start of the string (^\s*)
A punctuation mark followed by a space ([.!?]\s+).
[.!?] → Matches any of these three punctuation marks: . (period), ! (exclamation mark), ? (question mark).
\s+ → Matches one or more spaces after the punctuation. This ensures we're capturing proper sentence endings. Note that if there is no space after the . then the next letter wont be capitalized.
2. ([a-z])
This part captures a single lowercase letter that comes after the prefix.

([a-z]) → Matches any lowercase letter (a to z) and captures it in group 2.
Flags Used: /g
g (global) → Ensures that the regex finds all matches in the string, not just the first one.
How the Replacement Works
This regex is used inside .replace() with a callback function:


(match, before, letter) => before + letter.toUpperCase()
match → The full matched text.
before → Captures either the start of the string or a sentence-ending punctuation plus space.
letter → The lowercase letter that needs to be capitalized.



match (full match) → The entire matched portion of the string.
before (capture group 1: (^\s*|[.!?]\s+)) → The detected sentence-starting condition:
Either leading spaces (^\s*)
Or a sentence-ending punctuation followed by spaces ([.!?]\s+).
letter (capture group 2: ([a-z])) → The first lowercase letter of the new sentence that needs to be capitalized.

How Capture Groups Map to Arguments
In .replace(), the function arguments follow this pattern:


.replace(regex, (match, group1, group2, group3, ..., offset, fullString) => { ... })
match → The entire matched portion of the string.
group1, group2, group3, ... → Capture groups in the order they appear in the regex.
offset → The index where the match starts in the original string.
fullString → The full original string.
