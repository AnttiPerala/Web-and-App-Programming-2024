You don't mind that I'm not
coming to the club tonight?

22
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,014
What are you gonna do?

23
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,060
Stay home. Read.

24
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,606
Read?

25
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,702
Read?

26
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,540
Read what, Renee?

27
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,299
It's nice to know
I can still make you laugh.

28
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,594
I like to laugh, Fred.

29
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,227
That's why I married you.

30
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,735
You can wake me up
when you get home if you want to.

31
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,791
What's that?

32
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,715
A videotape.

33
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,638
I found it outside on the steps.

34
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,143
Who's it from?

35
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,313
I don't know.

36
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,900
There isn't anything on the envelope.

37
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,865
Does it say anything on the tape?

38
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,247
No. Nothing.

39
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,419
Well, let's see what's on it.

40
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,062
Come on.

41
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,938
Must be from a real estate agent.

42
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,274
Maybe.

It's okay.

48
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,783
It's okay.

49
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,461
I had a dream last night.

50
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,675
<i>You were inside the house.</i>

51
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,478
<i>You were calling my name.</i>

52
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,318
Fred?

53
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,366
<i>Fred?</i>

54
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,911
<i>Where are you?</i>

55
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,834
<i>I couldn't find you.</i>

56
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,775
<i>And there you were, lying in bed.</i>

57
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,444
<i>It wasn't you.</i>

58
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,199
<i>It looked like you, but it wasn't.</i>

59
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,141
Fred, are you all right?

60
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,002
You're up early.

61
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,047
The dog woke me.

62
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,685
Who the hell owns that dog?

63
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,782
What's that?

64
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,580
Another videotape?

65
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,208
Yes.

66
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,889
Don't you want to watch it?

67
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,101
I guess so.

68
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:27,036
Well, don't you want to watch it?

69
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,330
Yeah.

70
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,427
It's the same thing.

71
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,350
No, it isn't.

72
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,069
Fred?

73
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,835
What?

74
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,224
We have to call the police.

75
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,477
That's right. Yes.

76
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:42,111
S-Someone broke in
and taped us while we slept.

77
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,821
Isn't that enough?

78
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,952
7035 Hollis.

79
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,663
Near the observatory.

80
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:54,958
Yes.

81
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,253
We'll be here.

82
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,716
So?

83
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,637
They're sending two detectives out.

84
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:25,697
That's it.

85
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,449
What do you think?

86
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,743
I really don't know.

87
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:42,380
Let's check the hallway and the bedroom.

88
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,864
This is the bedroom?

89
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:12,118
You sleep here, in this room?
Both of youse?

90
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,749
This is our bedroom.

91
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,420
There's no other bedroom?

92
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,923
No.

93
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:32,263
I mean... I use it as a practice room.

94
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,474
It's soundproof.

95
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,601
You're a musician?

96
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,519
Yeah.

97
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,606
-What's your ax?
-Tenor.

98
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,359
Tenor saxophone.

99
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,029
- Do you...
- No. Tone deaf.

100
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,157
Do you own a video camera?

101
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,241
No.

102
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,787
Fred hates them.

103
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,214
I like to remember things my own way.

104
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,342
What do you mean by that?

105
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,638
How I remembered them.

106
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:16,349
Not necessarily the way they happened.

107
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,605
You have an alarm system?

108
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,941
Yes. Actually, we do.

109
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,112
But w-we haven't been using it lately.

110
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,364
Why not?

111
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,576
It kept going off...

112
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,247
for some reason.

113
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,998
It was false alarms.

114
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,919
Might want to try and use it again.

115
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:46,713
Yeah.

116
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,883
Okay.

117
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,847
We're going to check
the windows and doors,

118
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,765
see if anybody tried to break in.

119
00:25:57,849 --> 00:25:59,642
Okay.

120
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,800
We'll keep watch over the house.

121
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,593
We'll do the best we can.

122
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,306
-If anything else happens, you'll call us.
-We will.

123
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,101
Thanks, guys.

124
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,145
It's what we do.

125
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:04,350
-Hey, Andy! Great party!
-Julie!

126
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,020
-You look ravishing.
-Thank you.

127
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:24,120
Fred?

128
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:26,998
Please?

129
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,293
Please?

130
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:33,421
Hey.

131
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:52,315
-Two double scotches, neat.
-Got it.

132
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,036
We've met before, haven't we?

133
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,124
I don't think so.

134
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,922
Where was it you think we met?

135
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,509
At your house. Don't you remember?

136
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,181
No. No, I don't.

137
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,767
Are you sure?

138
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:11,811
Of course.

139
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:18,025
As a matter of fact, I'm there right now.

140
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,117
What do you mean? You're where right now?

141
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,079
At your house.

142
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,752
That's fucking crazy, man.

143
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,096
Call me.

144
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:54,854
Dial your number.

145
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,526
Go ahead.

146
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,707
<i>I told you I was here.</i>

147
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,421
How'd you do that?

148
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,801
Ask me.

149
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,310
How'd you get inside my house?

150
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,020
<i>You invited me.</i>

151
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:39,398
<i>It is not my custom
to go where I'm not wanted.</i>

152
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:42,234
Who are you?

153
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:45,404
Hmm.

154
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:52,578
<i>Give me back my phone.</i>

155
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,883
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

156
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,571
-I thought you were getting me a drink.
-Hang on just a minute.

157
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,700
Andy, who's the guy on the stairs?

158
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,702
The guy in black.

159
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,706
I don't know his name.
He's a friend of Dick Laurent, I think.

160
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:44,463
Dick Laurent?

161
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,508
Yeah. I believe so.

162
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,600
But Dick Laurent is dead,
isn't he?

163
00:32:58,644 --> 00:32:59,854
He is?

164
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,942
I didn't think you knew Dick.
How do you know he's dead?

165
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,156
I don't.

166
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,867
I don't know him.

167
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,036
No, Dick can't be dead.

168
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,497
Who told you he was dead?

169
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,167
Who, honey?

170
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,169
Who's dead?

171
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,631
-Let's go home.
-But <i>—</i>

172
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,842
Now. We're leaving now.

173
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,514
We never should have come here
in the first place.

174
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,274
So, how'd you meet
that asshole Andy anyway?

175
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,779
It was a long time ago.

176
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,327
We met at a place called Moke's.

177
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,663
We became friends.

178
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,458
He told me about a job.

179
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,336
What job?

180
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,423
I don't remember.

181
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,845
Anyway, Andy's okay.

182
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,476
Well, he's got some
pretty fucked-up friends.

183
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,404
Hey. HEY!

184
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:34,740
Stay in the car.

185
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,206
I told you to stay in the car.

186
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,208
Why?

187
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,419
What is it?

188
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,130
Why did you make me stay out here?

189
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,632
Hmm?

190
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:19,720
I'll tell you why. Because I thought
someone was inside the house.

191
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:24,683
Was there?

192
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,645
No, of course not.

193
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:15,771
Fred?

194
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,656
Fred, where are you?

195
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,624
Renee!

196
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,127
Renee!

197
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,504
Sit down, killer!

198
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,469
I didn't kill her.

199
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,100
Tell me I didn't kill her.

200
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,615
<i>We, the jury,
find the defendant guilty</i>

201
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,701
<i>of murder in the first degree.</i>

202
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,834
<i>Fred Madison,</i>

203
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,212
<i>the jury having found you guilty
of murder in the first degree,</i>

204
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:12,924
<i>it is my order that you be put to death
in the electric chair.</i>

205
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,314
Make yourself to home, fella.

206
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:30,484
Need anything, just ask the concierge.

207
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,410
Stick your hand out, chief.

208
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:56,338
Something wrong?

209
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,676
It's...

210
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,886
my head.

211
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,289
You sleeping okay?

212
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:33,458
No.

213
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,127
I can't sleep.

214
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,846
You'll sleep now.

215
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,975
-Take him back to his cell.
-Okay, Doc.

216
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:34,644
Let's go.

217
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,283
Guard!

218
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,288
Guard!

219
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,509
Guard!

220
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:12,849
Hey.

221
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,562
What do you want?

222
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:20,857
Aspirin.

223
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,150
My head.

224
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:26,404
Hey. Hey-

225
00:48:39,793 --> 00:48:41,252
Shit.

226
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,463
That wife killer's
looking pretty fucked up.

227
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,007

Pete, don't go!

00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,496
-Pete!
-Pete! Pete!

Pete! Pete!

238
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:11,879
Fuck me.

239
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:23,891
Well, Mack, what's the situation?

240
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:26,978
I'm not entirely certain, Captain.
You'll have to see for yourself.

241
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:44,454
Right here.

242
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:51,294
That's not Fred Madison.

243
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:55,673
No, sir. It's not.

244
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,388
-Who is it?
-I couldn't say, sir.

245
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:06,642
Captain Luneau?

246
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:08,227
Yeah, Mack?

247
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,730
Captain...

248
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:13,566
this is some spooky shit we got here.

249
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:26,245
Well, gentlemen,
we know who the stranger is.

250
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:30,625
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
Twenty-four years old.

251
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,253
Arrested five years ago for auto theft,

252
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:38,758
for which he was put on probation
for one year.

253
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:42,178
He lives with his parents,
William and Candace Dayton,

254
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:45,473
at 814 Garland Avenue.

255
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,820
-Here.
-Thanks, Lou.

256
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:17,268
Where the fuck have you been, man?

257
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,769
Hey!

258
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,354
-Shit. Yeah.
-Hey, buddy.

259
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,481
-What's up, man?
-Hey, man.

260
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:23,608
-Hey.
-Hey.

261
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,944
Hey, uh... Oh, you look like shit.

262
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:28,946
Yeah. What happened?

263
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:32,491
Um, just haven't been feeling so good.

264
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:34,285
You're not contagious, are you?

265
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,454
No, uh, I don't think so.

266
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,247
All right.
Well, let's go for a drive then.

267
00:57:38,331 --> 00:57:40,958
Different kinds of fruits grow and ripen.

268
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,754
<i>It takes many strawberfies
to fill a bucket.</i>

269
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:47,214
<i>But it's worth it when you know that...</i>

270
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:49,592
-Oh!
-Come on, man.

271
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,594
Hey. Come on, homey.

272
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:55,806
<i>...and a glass of fresh, cold milk
from grandfather's cows.</i>

273
00:57:58,392 --> 00:57:59,602
See you later.

274
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:02,063
I'm gonna go out
with these clowns for a while.

275
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,689
That should do you some good.

276
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,192
-Good night, honey.
-See ya.

277
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,693
Good night.

278
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,725
What's happening to you?

279
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,104
What happened to your face?

280
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,650
-I don't know.
-What do you mean?

281
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,195
You've been acting strange lately.

282
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:53,739
Like the other night?

283
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,868
What night?

284
00:58:57,952 --> 00:58:59,829
The last time I saw you.

285
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,832
I don't remember.

286
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:08,921

Pete!

292
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,210
-Arnie.
-Where you been?

293
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,421
-How you doing?
-It's good you're back.

294
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,298
Wonderful.

295
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:53,966
-Good to see you, man.
-Really, man.

296
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:58,679
A lot of people gonna be real happy
that you're back, including me.

297
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:00,389
Well, it's good to be back.

298
01:00:00,473 --> 01:00:02,349
Mr. Smith is waiting for you.

299
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,393
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

300
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:06,979
And Mr. Eddy called.

301
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,024
-Can I call him and tell him to come in?
-Yeah. Call him.

302
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:13,569
Tell him I'm back, and, uh, you know,
I'm-I'm-I'm ready to work.

303
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,112
-You're ready to work?
-Yeah.

304
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:16,864
-Well, let's go to work.
-All right, buddy.

305
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,745
Petey's back!

306
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:42,223
There's nine people down here.

307
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:45,309
You can ask seven of them.

308
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,812
And if you get that price
from one of them,

309
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:50,606
I'll let you ask the other two.

310
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,159
Hey, Pete!

311
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,455
Pete!

312
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:10,835
Where's Pete?

313
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:13,003
He's back there.

314
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,213
Mr. Eddy.

315
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:18,509
Hey.

316
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:24,348
What happened?
Somebody giving you trouble?

317
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,183
No. No trouble.

318
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,978
'Cause if somebody's
giving you trouble, Pete,

319
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:32,106
I can take care of the problem... like that.

320
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:36,652
-No. I-I'm fine, Mr. Eddy.
-I mean it, Pete. Like... that.

321
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,279
Thank you. Really, I'm fine.

322
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:40,865
So, uh, what do you want,
just a regular tune-up?

323
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:43,409
No, I want you to take a ride with me.

324
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,369
I don't like the sound of something.

325
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,454
Okay. I got to check it
with the <i>—</i> with the boss.

326
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:50,332
It's okay with Arnie. Come on. Let's go.

327
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:27,995
Pull it over, but keep it running.

328
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:51,060
Best goddamn ears in town.

329
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,826
Give that a try.

330
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,960
Beautiful.

331
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:20,547
Smooth as shit from a duck's ass.

332
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,719
-Let's take a ride.
-Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.

333
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,276
It's a beautiful day.

334
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:51,870
You did a great job, Pete. Yeah.

335
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:54,748
Well, you know I like working
on this car, Mr. Eddy.

336
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:14,977
Oh, shit. That cocksucker doing
what I think he's doing?

337
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:52,097
This is where mechanical excellence
and 1,400 horsepower pays off.

338
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:31,136
Oh, God!

339
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:39,728
Don't you ever fucking tailgate!

340
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:41,105
Even

341
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:43,190
-Tell him you won't tailgate.
-Ever!

342
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,858
I won't <i>—</i> I won't ever <i>—</i>

343
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,444
Do you know how many
fucking car lengths it takes

344
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:50,280
to stop a car at 35 miles an hour?

345
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,074
Six fucking car lengths!

346
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:54,576
That's 106 fucking feet, mister!

347
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,621
If I had to stop suddenly,
you would've hit me!

348
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,915
I want you to get
a fucking driver's manual,

349
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,334
and I want you to study that motherfucker!

350
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,670
And I want you to obey the goddamn rules!

351
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:09,299
Fifty fucking thousand people
were killed on the highway last year

352
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:11,927
because of fucking assholes like you!

353
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:15,514
Tell me you're going to get a manual!

354
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,392
I'm gonna... get a manual.

355
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,437
Fuckin'-A!

356
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:26,692
Oh, God!

357
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:56,889
Oh, God!

358
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:08,817
I'm sorry about that, Pete.

359
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:11,987
But tailgating is one thing
I cannot tolerate.

360
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:15,699
Yeah, I can see that.

361
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:28,128
Wait a minute.

362
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,344
-Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
-No, thank you.

363
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:37,804
I'm bringing the Caddy by tomorrow.

364
01:07:40,015 --> 01:07:41,225
You like pornos?

365
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,436
-Pornos?
-Give you a boner?

366
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:48,398
Uh, no. No, thanks. No.

367
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,692
Suit yourself, champ.

368
01:07:51,944 --> 01:07:55,948
-Well, uh, I-I'LL see you then.
-You will.

369
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:03,872
Damn.

370
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:14,967
Lou, you recognize that guy?

371
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,470
Yeah.

372
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:19,846
Laurent.

373
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:34,338
-What do you want?
-Want to go for a drive?

374
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:38,216
I don't know.

375
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:41,345
Get in, baby.

376
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,910
Come here.

377
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:51,248
-Why don't you like me?
-I do like you.

378
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,417
How much?

379
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:03,653
Oh, Pete.

380
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,495
Sheila.

381
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:14,706
Oh, Sheila.

382
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,834
What'd you change it for?

383
01:13:01,086 --> 01:13:02,420
I like that.

384
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:04,881
Well, I don't.

385
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:16,685
I like that.

386
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,888
I'm leaving the Caddy like I told you.

387
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:56,725
Think you'll get a chance
to give her the once-over today?

388
01:13:56,808 --> 01:14:01,062
Sure. Uh, you want to pick it up later on
or, uh, or in the morning?

389
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:04,649
Well, if you think you can finish it,
I'll be back later today.

390
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:08,445
-It'll be done.
-You're my man, Pete.

I'm Alice Wakefield.

409
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:03,953
Pete Dayton.

410
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,916
I was here earlier.

411
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:09,626
Yeah, I remember.

412
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,009
How'd you like to take me to dinner?

413
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,597
I-I don't know, um...

414
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:29,813
Okay.

415
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:33,983
Why don't I take you to dinner?

416
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:40,657
Look, uh, I don't think
this is a very good idea.

417
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:49,290
Do you have a phone?

418
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:54,462
Yeah.

419
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:56,548
It's right... It's right there.

420
01:17:57,465 --> 01:18:00,009
I have to call myself another taxi.

421
01:18:10,812 --> 01:18:13,398
Hello? Van Nuys?

422
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:16,901
Could I have the number for Vanguard Cab?

423
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:33,209
Hello. Yes, I need a taxi.

424
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:35,128
Arnie's Garage, the corner of Fifth <i>—</i>

425
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:38,756
Hello. Uh, yeah, we're not
going to need that cab.

426
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,924
Thanks.

427
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:58,401
Maybe we should just skip dinner.

428
01:19:32,477 --> 01:19:34,103
Take my clothes off.

429
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:40,777
Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.

430
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,528
Mmm.

431
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:35,164
-I want more.
-Me, too.

432
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:41,379
Can I call you?

433
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:45,925
Yeah. Call me at home.
I'll give you the number.

434
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:53,641
Okay, baby.

435
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:23,755
Hey! Up here.

436
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:27,592
Come on up, baby.
I already got the room.

437
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:03,795
I'll get it.

438
01:22:03,878 --> 01:22:04,921
Hello?

439
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:08,466
Meow, meow. It's me.

440
01:22:09,467 --> 01:22:11,010
Hey, baby.

441
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:14,263
I can't see you tonight.

442
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:19,268
Okay.

443
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,815
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.

444
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:26,317
Sure.

445
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:32,782
I think he suspects something.
We have to be careful.

-Sit down.

475
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,565
You don't look so good.

476
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:15,319
No, I just, uh —just have a headache.

Ah.

478
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:18,447
What's going on?

479
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:21,909
The police called us.

480
01:25:24,537 --> 01:25:25,746
What'd they want?

481
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:28,874
They want to know if we had had a chance

482
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:31,335
to find out what happened to you
the other night.

483
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:35,214
And they want to know
if you remembered anything.

484
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:41,429
But I don't remember anything.

485
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:45,224
What'd you tell them?

486
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:52,898
We're not gonna say anything...

487
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:56,152
about that night to the police.

488
01:25:59,322 --> 01:26:01,324
We saw you that night, Pete.

489
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:07,246
You came home with your friend Sheila.

490
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:10,624
Sheila?

491
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:16,505
Yeah. There was a man with you.

492
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:18,549
What is this?

493
01:26:19,467 --> 01:26:21,469
Why didn't you tell me anything?

494
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:28,017
Who's the man?

495
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:33,064
I've never seen him before in my life.

496
01:26:38,736 --> 01:26:40,863
What happened to me?

497
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,576
Please. Please, Dad.

498
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:46,869
Tell me.

499
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:06,639
Hey, Pete!

500
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:08,474
No!

501
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:21,779
Hey.

502
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:25,699
Mr. Eddy.

503
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,210
Hey, Pete.

504
01:27:37,378 --> 01:27:39,380
-How you doing?
-I'm okay.

505
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:42,758
I'm sure you noticed that girl
who was with me the other day.

506
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:46,011
Good-looking blonde.
She stayed in the car.

507
01:27:47,263 --> 01:27:48,597
Her name is Alice.

508
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:52,059
I swear, I love that girl to death.

509
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:59,191
If I ever found out
somebody was making out with her...

510
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:04,905
I'd take this,
and I'd shove it so far up his ass,

511
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:06,991
it would come out his mouth.

512
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:11,370
-And then you know what I'd do?
-What?

513
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:14,748
I'd blow his fucking brains out.

514
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:25,384
Hey. You're looking good.

515
01:28:27,178 --> 01:28:28,637
What you been up to?

516
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:40,065
I'll get it.

517
01:28:42,193 --> 01:28:43,277
Hello?

518
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:51,410
Meet me at the Starlight Hotel
on Sycamore in 20 minutes.

519
01:28:56,999 --> 01:28:58,584
He'll kill us.

520
01:29:02,463 --> 01:29:03,797
Are you, uh <i>—</i>

521
01:29:06,175 --> 01:29:08,219
you positive that he knows?

522
01:29:08,302 --> 01:29:10,721
I'm not positive, but he knows.

523
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:14,642
So...

524
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:19,146
what are we supposed to do?

525
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:24,109
I don't know.

526
01:29:55,766 --> 01:30:01,021
If we could just get some money,
we could go away together.

527
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:06,735
I know a guy.

528
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,865
He pays girls to party with him.

529
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:15,369
He's always got a lot of cash.

530
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:18,706
He'd be easy to rob.

531
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:22,501
Then we'd have the money.

532
01:30:23,419 --> 01:30:25,629
We could go away.

533
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:28,507
We could be together.

534
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:39,393
Have you partied with him?

535
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:47,359
Did you like it?

536
01:30:49,445 --> 01:30:50,654
No.

537
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:53,324
It was part of the deal.

538
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:56,285
What deal?

539
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:01,999
-He works for Mr. Eddy.
-Yeah?

540
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:06,545
-And what's he do?
-He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

541
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:08,547
Pornos?

542
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:10,591
Yeah.

543
01:31:11,467 --> 01:31:14,094
How did you get in
with these fucking people, Alice?

544
01:31:14,178 --> 01:31:15,846
-Pete <i>—</i>
-No "Pete."

545
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,682
I want to know how it happened.

546
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,813
It was a long time ago.

547
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:30,819
I met this guy at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.

548
01:31:32,613 --> 01:31:34,907
He told me about a job.

549
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:41,914
In pornos?

550
01:31:44,458 --> 01:31:45,793
No.

551
01:31:46,794 --> 01:31:49,672
Just a job. I didn't know what.

552
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:56,261
He made an appointment
for me to see a man.

553
01:31:57,805 --> 01:31:59,431
<i>I went to this place.</i>

554
01:32:01,892 --> 01:32:04,019
<i>They made me wait there forever.</i>

555
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:08,023
<i>There was a guy guarding the door.</i>

556
01:32:13,112 --> 01:32:16,156
<i>In another room, there was
this other guy lifting weights.</i>

557
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,332
<i>I started getting nervous.</i>

558
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:28,460
<i>When it got dark...</i>

559
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:33,674

You liked it, huh?

584
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:17,129
If you want me to go away,

585
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:20,841
I'll go away.

586
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,890
I don't want you to go away.

587
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:31,018
I don't want you to go away.

588
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:42,529
I love you, Alice.

589
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:49,870
-Should I call Andy?
-Andy?

590
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,083
That's his name. Andy.
Our ticket out of here.

591
01:35:55,876 --> 01:35:58,337
Yeah. Call him.

592
01:36:00,756 --> 01:36:03,759
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.

593
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:06,678
You meet me at his place at 11 o'clock.

594
01:36:07,638 --> 01:36:09,765
Don't drive. Take the bus.

595
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:11,725
Make sure no one follows you.

596
01:36:12,643 --> 01:36:14,728
His address is easy to remember.

597
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:18,732
It's <i>2224</i> Deep Dell Place.

598
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:20,442
It's a white stucco job

599
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,611
on the south side of the street.

600
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,529
I'll be upstairs with Andy.

601
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,532
The back door will be open.

602
01:36:27,616 --> 01:36:29,868
Go through the kitchen
into the living room.

603
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:31,536
There's a bar there.

604
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:33,413
At 11:15,

605
01:36:33,497 --> 01:36:36,375
I'll send Andy down to fix me a drink.

606
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:37,876
And when he does,

607
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,170
you crack him in the head, okay?

608
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:45,175
Okay.

609
01:37:14,955 --> 01:37:17,582
-You're fucking somebody else, aren't you?
-Sheila.

610
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:19,918
-You fuck me whenever you want.
-Sheila. Sheila, stop it.

611
01:37:20,002 --> 01:37:22,421
-You don't call. Who is she?
-Stop it.

612
01:37:22,504 --> 01:37:24,464
-What's the bitch's name?
-I'm sorry.

613
01:37:24,548 --> 01:37:25,841
Oh, you're sorry.

614
01:37:25,924 --> 01:37:27,509
-Go home.
-You're sorry?

615
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:29,761
-Sheila, stop it.
-You're sorry, you piece of shit?

616
01:37:29,845 --> 01:37:31,555
-You're sorry?
-Go home.

617
01:37:31,638 --> 01:37:33,473
-Fuck you! Fuck you!
-Stop it, Sheila.

618
01:37:33,557 --> 01:37:35,600
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Sheila. Sheila.

619
01:37:35,684 --> 01:37:38,270
- Fuck you!
- Sheila. Sheila. Sheila.

620
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:40,689
Let's both go in
and talk about this quietly.

621
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:43,025
Sheila, come on.

622
01:37:43,942 --> 01:37:47,696
- You are different.
- Sheila.

623
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,157
Tell him. Tell him!

624
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:53,076
Sheila, don't. Don't.

625
01:37:55,037 --> 01:37:57,164
I don't care anymore anyway.

626
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,793
I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton.

627
01:38:02,669 --> 01:38:08,091
I won't bother you or any member
of your family ever again.

628
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:24,566
Pete?

629
01:38:27,277 --> 01:38:29,321
There's a man on the phone.

630
01:38:30,697 --> 01:38:33,366
He's called a couple of times tonight.

631
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:34,910
Who is it?

632
01:38:37,204 --> 01:38:39,372
He won't give his name.

633
01:38:57,974 --> 01:38:59,309
Hello?

634
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:01,603
<i>Hex Pete, how you doing?</i>

635
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:07,651
<i>-Who is this?
- You know who it is.</i>

636
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:13,865
MI'. Eddy?

637
01:39:14,533 --> 01:39:17,369
Yeah. How you doing, Pete?

638
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:20,997
-Okay.
-You're doing okay?

639
01:39:21,081 --> 01:39:22,749
That's good, Pete.

640
01:39:24,543 --> 01:39:28,421
Look, uh, it's late, Mr. Eddy. I, uh <i>—</i>

641
01:39:28,505 --> 01:39:30,507
I'm really glad to know you're doing okay.

642
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:37,055
You sure you're okay?
Everything all right?

643
01:39:38,557 --> 01:39:39,766
Yeah.

644
01:39:41,143 --> 01:39:43,812
I'm really glad to know
you're doing good, Pete.

645
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:47,274
Hey, I want you to talk
to a friend of mine.

646
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:55,157
We've met before, haven't we?

647
01:39:57,117 --> 01:39:58,535
I don't think so.

648
01:40:00,871 --> 01:40:02,622
Where is it you think we've met?

649
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:06,459
At your house. Don't you remember?

650
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:11,673
No.

651
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:14,759
No, I don't.

652
01:40:16,136 --> 01:40:19,264
In the East, the far East,

653
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:21,725
when a person is sentenced to death,

654
01:40:21,808 --> 01:40:24,644
they're sent to a place
where they can't escape,

655
01:40:25,687 --> 01:40:29,316
<i>never knowing when an executioner
may step up behind them</i>

656
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:33,028
and fire a bullet
into the back of their head.

657
01:40:34,154 --> 01:40:36,364
What's going on?

658
01:40:36,448 --> 01:40:38,700
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

659
01:40:40,035 --> 01:40:42,078
Pete, I just wanted to jump on

660
01:40:42,162 --> 01:40:44,831
and tell you that I'm really glad
you're doing okay.

661
01:44:01,027 --> 01:44:02,237
You got him.

662
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:06,157
Alice.

663
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:03,339
Wow.

664
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:07,969
We killed him.

665
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:18,521
You killed him.

666
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:23,693
Alice.

667
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:31,242
Alice. Alice.

668
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:33,328
What do we do?

669
01:45:34,454 --> 01:45:35,747
What do we do?

670
01:45:37,957 --> 01:45:39,834
We have to get the stuff.

671
01:45:41,961 --> 01:45:43,463
We have to get out of here.

672
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,355
Ah, fuck.

673
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:38,935
Is that you?

674
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:41,604
Are both of them you?

675
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:53,616
That's me.

676
01:46:55,118 --> 01:46:57,203
Honey, are you all right?

677
01:47:02,667 --> 01:47:04,294
Where's the bathroom?

678
01:47:05,545 --> 01:47:08,047
It's upstairs, down the hall.

679
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:08,566
Did you want to talk to me? Huh?

680
01:48:10,276 --> 01:48:13,446
Did you want to ask me, why?

681
01:49:11,796 --> 01:49:13,089
What's the matter?

682
01:49:16,008 --> 01:49:17,844
Don't you trust me, Pete?

683
01:49:17,927 --> 01:49:19,011
Hmm?

684
01:49:27,353 --> 01:49:29,272
Stick this in your pants.

685
01:49:36,738 --> 01:49:38,156
I know a fence.

686
01:49:41,576 --> 01:49:45,705
He'll give us money and get us passports
in exchange for all this shit...

687
01:49:46,664 --> 01:49:48,082
and Andy's car.

688
01:49:49,876 --> 01:49:52,211
And then we can go anywhere.

689
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:09,061
Come on, baby.

690
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:27,079
Pete, you drive.

691
01:50:42,637 --> 01:50:45,264
Where the fuck are we going, Alice?

692
01:50:47,433 --> 01:50:49,435
Where the fuck are we going?

693
01:50:52,897 --> 01:50:55,274
We have to go to the desert, baby.

694
01:50:58,277 --> 01:50:59,904
The fence I told you about?

695
01:51:04,075 --> 01:51:05,451
He's at his cabin.

696
01:52:20,276 --> 01:52:21,402
Come on.

697
01:53:09,033 --> 01:53:10,868
We'll have to wait.

698
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:33,724
Why me, Alice?

699
01:53:36,018 --> 01:53:37,436
Why choose me?

700
01:53:42,483 --> 01:53:44,485
You still want me, don't you, Pete?

701
01:53:48,781 --> 01:53:50,574
