(BUS APPROACHING)

2
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,702
Hello.

3
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,330
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

4
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,921
Do you want a chocolate?

5
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:37,927
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

6
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:44,308
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

7
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,188
You never know what you're gonna get.

8
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,948
Those must be comfortable shoes.

9
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,996
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,667
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,878
My feet hurt.

12
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,756
Mama always said there's an awful lot

13
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:18,050
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

14
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,138
where they're going,
where they've been.

15
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,439
I've worn lots of shoes.

16
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:39,363
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

17
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,911
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

18
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:48,331
<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>

19
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,584
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

20
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:01,344
Let's take a little walk around.

21
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,936
How do those feel?

22
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,066
His legs are strong, Mrs Gump,

23
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,652
as strong as I've ever seen,

24
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:21,113
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

25
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,493
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

26
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,702
Forrest!

27
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:29,413
<i>FORREST: Now, when I was a baby,</i>

28
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:32,333
<i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,</i>

29
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,836
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

30
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,129
<i>She said we was related to him
in some way.</i>

31
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:38,589
<i>And what he did was,</i>

32
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:42,927
<i>he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

33
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,347
<i>They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets</i>

34
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,768
<i>and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.</i>

35
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:54,730
<i>They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>

36
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:57,859
<i>And anyway, that's how I got my name,</i>

37
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:59,360
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

38
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,195
<i>Mama said that the "Forrest" part</i>

39
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,824
<i>was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,</i>

40
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,702
<i>well, just don't make no sense.</i>

41
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,161
(CLANG)

42
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,878
Okay... Get it, get it...

43
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,922
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

44
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,341
All right...

45
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,594
What are you all staring at?

46
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:29,140
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

47
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:34,395
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

48
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,064
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

49
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:39,275
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

50
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,068
<i>FORREST: Mama always had a way of
explaining things</i>

51
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,154
<i>so I could understand them.</i>

52
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:48,117
<i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i>

53
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,245
<i>about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>

54
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,081
<i>That's in the county of Greenbow.</i>

55
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:58,586
<i>Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa</i>

56
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,588
<i>had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,</i>

57
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,590
<i>something like that.</i>

58
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,384
<i>Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

59
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:08,220
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

60
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,264
<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>

61
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:14,310
<i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i>

62
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,104
<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>

63
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,941
<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>

64
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:25,029
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

65
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,909
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

66
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:34,163
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

67
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:39,126
Your boy's different, Mrs Gump.

68
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,420
Now, his IQ is 75.

69
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:45,341
Well, we're all different, Mr Hancock.

70
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,972
<i>FORREST: She wanted me to have
the finest education,</i>

71
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:54,976
<i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i>

72
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,311
<i>I met the principal and all.</i>

73
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:00,690
I want to show you something,
Mrs Gump.

74
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,026
Now, this is normal.

75
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:07,822
Forrest is right here.

76
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:14,203
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs Gump.

77
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:17,581
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

78
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,792
Now, he'll be just fine.

79
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,670
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

80
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:26,132
He might be a bit on the slow side,

81
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,010
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

82
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,637
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

83
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:35,516
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tyres.

84
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,769
We're talking about
five little points here.

85
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,107
There must be something can be done.

86
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,153
We're a progressive school system.

87
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:50,906
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

88
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,244
Is there a Mr Gump, Mrs Gump?

89
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,374
He's on vacation.

90
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,128
(GASPING AND PANTING)

91
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,645
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

92
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,612
You don't say much, do you?

93
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,160

94
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,084

"oh, what happened.

97
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:51,759
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

98
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,887
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

99
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,226
Vacation's when you go somewhere

100
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,939
and you don't ever come back.

101
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:13,072
<i>FORREST: Anyway, I guess you could
say me and Mama was on our own.</i>

102
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,910
<i>But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.</i>

103
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,579
<i>There was always folks
coming and going.</i>

104
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:21,747
MRS GUMP: Supper.

105
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:25,251
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

106
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,878
<i>FORREST: Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us</i>

107
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,631
<i>that every room
was filled with travellers.</i>

108
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,343
<i>You know, folks living out
of their suitcases</i>

109
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,388
<i>and hat cases and sample cases.</i>

110
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,891
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...

111
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,519
<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>

112
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:47,231
<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>

114
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:05,207

this nice young man.

ELVIS PRESLEY:
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

116
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:09,545
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

117
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,590
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

118
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,634
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

119
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:19,889
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

120
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,849

<i>This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,</i>

127
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,413
<i>and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,</i>

128

<i>had himself a heart attack,

135
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:17,112
Must be hard being a king.

00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,245
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

<i>FORREST: I remember the bus ride

Are you coming along?

140
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:44,014
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

141
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,267
This is the bus to school.

I don't recall what I got

on my first outdoor picnic.

But I do remember the first time I heard

152
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,703
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

What's wrong with your legs?

Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

<i>I just sat next to her on that bus</i>

<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>

161
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,321
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

162
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,572
These are going to make me...

163
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:28,410
<i>And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.</i>

164
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,913
Are you stupid or something?

165
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,999
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

166
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:39,296
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,301
I can't help it. I love you.

505
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,764
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

506
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:37,066
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

507
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:42,446
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

508
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,783
Yes, I do.

509
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,581
You think I could fly off this bridge?

510
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,423
What do you mean, Jenny?

511
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,804
Nothing.

512
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,809
I gotta get out of here.

513
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,187
Wait, Jenny...

514
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:19,733
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

515
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,110
Can I have a ride?

516
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,736
- MAN: Where you going?
- I don't care.

517
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,196
Get in the truck.

518
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,115
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

519
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,953
They sending me to Vietnam.

520
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:36,125
It's this whole other country.

521
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,629
Just hang on a minute.

522
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,092
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

523
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:48,512
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

524
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,222
Just run away.

525
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:52,808
Okay.

526
00:39:57,688 --> 00:39:59,023
Jenny.

527
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,193
I'll write you all the time.

528
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:15,331
<i>FORREST: And just like that,
she was gone.</i>

529
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,767
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

530
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,022
<i>Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different</i>

531
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:24,984
<i>from the United States of America.</i>

532
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:30,114
<i>And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.</i>

533
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:43,335
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

534
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:46,588
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

535
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:50,217
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

536
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,510
we can get American shrimpers

537
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,345
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

538
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:54,972
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

539
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:58,267
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

540
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,853
You must be my FNGs.

541
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,187
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

542
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:04,898
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

543
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:07,109
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

544
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:10,029
who would love to grease an officer.

545
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:13,615
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

546
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,910
What's wrong with your lip?

547
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:19,371
I was born with big gums, sir.

548
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:24,168
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

549
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,712
Where you boys from in the world?

550
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:29,173
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

551
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:31,383
You twins?

552
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,888
No, we are not relations, sir.

553
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,060
Look, it's pretty basic here.

554
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:44,313
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

555
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:47,066
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

556
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,068
There is one item of GI gear

557
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:53,322
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

558
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,825
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

559
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:58,202
Try and keep your feet dry.

560
00:42:58,327 --> 00:42:59,745
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

561
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,289
to change your socks whenever we stop.

562
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:05,334
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

563
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,711
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

564
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,254
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

565
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:11,256
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

566
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,342
DAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

567
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,969
<i>FORREST: Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.</i>

568
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:18,347
<i>I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.</i>

569
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:22,559
<i>He was from a long,
great military tradition.</i>

570
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:25,854
<i>Somebody in his family
had fought and died</i>

571
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:31,110
<i>in every single American war.</i>

572
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:34,029
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

573
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:35,239
Get on it!

574
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:38,700
<i>I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.</i>

575
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:45,249
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

576
00:43:45,374 --> 00:43:47,543
Little Rock's a fine town.

577
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,797
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

578
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,341
draw what you need for the field.

579
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:58,387
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

580
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,348
Two standing orders in this platoon:

581
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,101
one, take good care of your feet,

582
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:09,273
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

583
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,823
I sure hope I don't let him down.

584
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:31,920
<i>FORREST: I got to see
a lot of the countryside.</i>

585
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:34,339
<i>We would take these real long walks.</i>

586
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:46,935
<i>And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.</i>

587
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:57,029
DAN: Hold it up!
SOLDIER: Hold up, boys!

588
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:02,201
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

589
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:06,580
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,</i>

590
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:11,752
<i>or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...</i>

591
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:13,837
Get down! Shut up!

592
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,256
<i>(WHISPERING)...so we did.</i>

593
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,984
<i>Now, I don't know much about anything,</i>

594
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:39,905
<i>but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.</i>

595
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:42,699
<i>There was Dallas, from Phoenix,</i>

596
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,204
<i>Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</i>

597
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:49,706
(WHISPERING) Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

598
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,000
Man, what the hell's going on?

599
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:56,421
<i>And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.</i>

600
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:58,048
DAN: Nothing.

601
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,680
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

602
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:08,475
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

603
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,352
Come on, move out.

604
00:46:12,396 --> 00:46:14,815
Step it up. Look alive out there.

605
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:19,236
<i>The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.</i>

606
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:20,737
DAN: Fire in the hole!

607
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,535
Gump, check out that hole.

608
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:29,621
<i>And there was always something to do.</i>

609
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:32,874
- Mount them up.
- SOLDIER: Spread out! Cover his back.

610
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:43,552
<i>One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

611
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:47,431
<i>We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:</i>

612
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:50,100
<i>little bitty stinging rain,</i>

613
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,478
<i>and big old fat rain,</i>

614
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,648
<i>rain that flew in sideways.</i>

615
00:46:56,732 --> 00:47:00,777
<i>And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.</i>

616
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:04,948
<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>

617
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:08,452
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

618
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:11,872
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

619
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:15,792
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

620
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:20,213
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

621
00:47:20,297 --> 00:47:22,799
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

622
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,801
like brothers and stuff.

623
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:30,432
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

624
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,518
I got a very important question
to ask you.

625
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:39,107
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

626
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,902
Okay.

627
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:45,447
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

628
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,325
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

629
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,745
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

630
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:54,122
We ain't got to pay no rent.

631
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:56,291
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

632
00:47:56,375 --> 00:48:00,629
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

633
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:04,299
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

634
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,636
That's a fine idea.

635
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,847
<i>FORREST: Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>

636
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:17,729
<i>I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.</i>

637
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:21,733
<i>I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.</i>

638
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:26,822
<i>I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,</i>

639
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,658
<i>and told her
how I thought about her always,</i>

640
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,954
<i>and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her</i>

641
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:36,540
<i>just as soon as she had the time.</i>

642
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:40,919
<i>I'd always let her know that I was okay.</i>

643
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:47,384
<i>Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."</i>

644
00:49:02,232 --> 00:49:05,986
<i>This one day, we was out walking,
like always,</i>

645
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:09,030
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

646
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:13,368
<i>somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.</i>

647
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:18,206
DAN: Ambush!

648
00:49:18,707 --> 00:49:20,083
Take cover!

649
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,626
(GUNS FIRING)

650
00:49:23,712 --> 00:49:24,880
Get down!

651
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,423
Get the sixty!

652
00:49:29,593 --> 00:49:31,678
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

653
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,889
Forrest, you okay?

654
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,728
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

655
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,689
Medic, we got a man down!

656
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:45,734
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

657
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:49,779
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

658
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:53,408
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

659
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,869
Misfire! Misfire!

660
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,248
DAN: God damn it! Mac!

661
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:04,628
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

662
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:06,755
Jesus!

663
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,090
My unit is down hard and hurting!

664
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:12,761
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

665
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,514
Pull back! Pull back!

666
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:17,724
Run! Run, Forrest!

667
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:20,143
- Pull back!
- BUBBA: Forrest, Forrest!

668
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:22,854
Run, man! Run!

669
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:24,731
DAN: Pull back! Run!

670
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,777
Run, God damn it, run!

671
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:54,594
SOLDIER: Medic! Can I get a medic?

672
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:58,306
<i>FORREST: I ran and ran,
just like Jenny told me to.</i>

673
00:51:01,685 --> 00:51:05,897
<i>I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,</i>

674
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,941
<i>which was a bad thing.</i>

675
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:10,026
Bubba!

676
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:15,949
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.</i>

677
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:21,705
SOLDIER 1: Any friendlies out there?

678
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:24,833
SOLDIER 2: Yeah, I've got
three over here.

679
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,460
Where the hell are you?

680
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,379
Bubba?

681
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:33,174
<i>And on my way back to find Bubba,</i>

682
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,094
<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>

683
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,387
Tex!

684
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:40,473
Okay.

685
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:44,519
<i>I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,</i>

686
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:48,523
<i>so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.</i>

687
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:06,082
<i>And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>

688
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,711
<i>somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."</i>

689
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:19,262
Can't hear... Can't hear...

690
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:22,849
SOLDIER: No sweat, man. Just lay back.

691
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:25,435
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

692
00:52:27,437 --> 00:52:30,482
<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>

693
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:31,816
<i>MAN ON RADIO:...over.</i>

694
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,195
DAN: Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

695
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:37,113
We got Charlie all over this area.

696
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,532
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

697
00:52:39,616 --> 00:52:42,994
<i>- Six, Strongarm, we want...</i>
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

698
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:44,287
I know he's dead!

699
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:47,248
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

700
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:48,708
<i>- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.</i>
- God damn it!

701
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:51,503
<i>- Copy this transmission. Over.</i>
- What are you doing?

702
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:54,923
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

703
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:57,342
<i>Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.</i>

704
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:00,053
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

705
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:03,306
<i>Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised</i>

706
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:05,392
<i>your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.</i>

707
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:08,895
<i>FORREST: Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>

708
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:11,439
Something bit me!

709
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,448
You chink son of a bitch!

710
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:24,953
I can't leave the platoon.

711
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:29,999
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

712
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,252
Did you hear what I said?

713
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:34,921
God damn it, put me down!

714
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,674
Get your ass out of here!

715
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:43,555
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

716
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:44,973
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

717
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:46,182
To get Bubba.

718
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:50,145
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

719
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,647
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

720
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:55,191
I gotta find Bubba!

721
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,625
BUBBA: Forrest.

722
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:23,052
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

723
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:25,513
I'm okay.

724
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,190
Oh, Bubba, no...

725
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:37,525
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

726
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:41,279
(MEN CHATTERING)

727
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,369
Come on. Come on. Come on.

728
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,876
I'm okay, Forrest.

729
00:54:56,211 --> 00:54:59,047
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

730
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:39,212
DAN: Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

731
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:44,759
<i>If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>

732
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:47,178
<i>I'd of thought of something better to say.</i>

733
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,763
Hey, Bubba.

734
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,266
Hey, Forrest.

735
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:56,813
Forrest, why'd this happen?

736
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,941
You got shot.

737
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:05,822
<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>

738
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:08,283
I wanna go home.

739
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:12,328
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

740
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:17,834
<i>And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.</i>

741
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:21,045
<i>Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>

742
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:25,091
<i>but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>

743
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:33,099
That's all I have to say about that.

744
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:37,645
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

745
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:42,650
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

746
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:47,113
Oh, yes, sir.

747
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:50,325
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

748
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:55,705
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

749
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:59,667
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

750
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:04,005
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

751
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,840
<i>is the ice cream.</i>

752
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:08,551
<i>They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.</i>

753
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:09,969
<i>And guess what?</i>

754
00:57:10,053 --> 00:57:13,181
<i>A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.</i>

755
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:18,478
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

756
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:23,024
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

757
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:37,038
MALE NURSE:
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

758
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:46,881
Harper!

759
00:57:50,093 --> 00:57:52,553
Cooper, Larson,

760
00:57:54,764 --> 00:57:56,099
Webster,

761
00:57:57,517 --> 00:58:01,020
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

762
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:07,860
Kyle, Nichols,

763
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:16,035
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

764
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,746
Holiday...

765
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:27,755
<i>MAN ON TV:
Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

766
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:33,594
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

767
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,263
<i>- From the DMZ to the Delta...</i>
- Turn it off!

768
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:38,599
<i>...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.</i>

769
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:41,060
<i>This is Channel 6, Saigon.</i>

770
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,440
SOLDIER: Good catch, Gump.

771
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,569
You know how to play this?

772
00:58:50,862 --> 00:58:52,947
Come on, let me show you. Here.

773
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:57,368
Now, the secret to this game is,

774
00:58:57,452 --> 00:59:03,291
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

775
00:59:06,878 --> 00:59:08,212
All right.

776
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:15,219
<i>For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>

777
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:18,473
See? Any idiot can play.

778
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:21,726
<i>So, I started playing it all the time.</i>

779
00:59:22,894 --> 00:59:24,228
<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>

780
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:27,607
<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>

781
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:40,328
<i>The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,</i>

782
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:42,288
<i>whatever that means.</i>

783
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:46,000
<i>Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.</i>

784
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:55,384
<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.</i>

785
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:08,272
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

786
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:11,400
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

787
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:14,195
I should have died out there
with my men,

788
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,282
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

789
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:21,994
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

790
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:23,830
Do you see that?

791
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:27,708
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

792
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:32,672
Yes, sir, I do.

793
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:38,386
Did you hear what I said?

794
01:00:39,262 --> 01:00:41,013
You cheated me.

795
01:00:41,097 --> 01:00:42,265
I had a destiny.

796
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:45,893
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honour!

797
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:50,606
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

798
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:02,952
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

799
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:08,457
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

800
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:12,753
I had a destiny.

801
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:19,093
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

802
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:27,602
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

803
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,335
Look at me.

804
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,630
What am I gonna do now?

805
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,344
What am I gonna do now?

806
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:13,189
PFC Gump?

807
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:16,150
Yes, sir!

808
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,319
As you were.

809
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:22,657
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honour.

810
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:27,328
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

811
01:02:34,085 --> 01:02:37,838
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

812
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:40,549
They sent him home.

813
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:49,308
<i>FORREST:
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</i>

814
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:53,896
<i>The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President</i>

815
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:57,358
<i>regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.</i>

816
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,568
<i>President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honour</i>

817
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:01,320
<i>to men
from each of the Armed Services.</i>

818
01:03:01,404 --> 01:03:04,323
<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>

819
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:10,121
<i>I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?</i>

820
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:13,374
<i>- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.</i>

821
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,419
<i>I'd kind of like to see that.</i>

822
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:29,140
(CHUCKLING)

823
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:32,018
<i>God damn, son.</i>

824
01:03:34,145 --> 01:03:37,982
<i>After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,</i>

825
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:41,569
<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>

826
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:43,195
ISABEL: Hilary, all right,
I've got the vets,

827
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:44,780
what do you want me to do with them?

828
01:03:44,864 --> 01:03:46,615
HILARY: What are you doing here
so late?

829
01:03:46,699 --> 01:03:50,745
<i>It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded</i>

830
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:53,998
<i>with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,</i>

831
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:56,709
<i>and some of them people were loud
and pushy.</i>

832
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,754
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

833
01:04:00,588 --> 01:04:03,549
<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>

834
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:08,346
HILARY: Follow me, let's go!

835
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:11,766
Come on. Let's go.

836
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:19,398
Stand here.

837
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:25,029
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

838
01:04:26,322 --> 01:04:27,448
Okay.

839
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,619
<i>There was this man giving a little talk.</i>

02:02:09,114 --> 02:02:11,575
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1491
02:02:12,868 --> 02:02:14,912
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1492
02:02:29,385 --> 02:02:30,594
Hey.

1493
02:02:31,762 --> 02:02:34,640
Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest.

1494
02:02:37,226 --> 02:02:41,355
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1495
02:02:41,897 --> 02:02:43,274
Okay?

1496
02:02:47,611 --> 02:02:49,488
Isn't he beautiful?

1497
02:02:50,489 --> 02:02:53,450
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1498
02:02:57,246 --> 02:02:58,330
But...

1499
02:03:02,001 --> 02:03:04,879
Is he smart, or...

1500
02:03:04,962 --> 02:03:08,966
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1501
02:03:18,309 --> 02:03:20,769
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1502
02:03:30,112 --> 02:03:32,948
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1503
02:03:56,055 --> 02:03:57,848
Forrest,

1504
02:03:59,308 --> 02:04:00,851
I'm sick.

1505
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,149
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1506
02:04:07,232 --> 02:04:09,610
I have some kind of virus,

1507
02:04:09,693 --> 02:04:12,404
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1508
02:04:12,529 --> 02:04:15,532
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1509
02:04:19,912 --> 02:04:22,206
You could come home with me.

1510
02:04:23,874 --> 02:04:29,546
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1511
02:04:33,884 --> 02:04:36,679
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1512
02:04:39,056 --> 02:04:41,350
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1513
02:04:46,605 --> 02:04:47,856
Okay.

1514
02:04:48,899 --> 02:04:50,567
MINISTER: Please take your seats.

1515
02:04:54,405 --> 02:04:56,740
Forrest? It's time to start.

1516
02:05:16,135 --> 02:05:17,720
Hi.

1517
02:05:18,595 --> 02:05:20,097
Your tie.

1518
02:05:32,651 --> 02:05:34,278
Lieutenant Dan.

1519
02:05:49,626 --> 02:05:51,587
Lieutenant Dan.

1520
02:05:52,421 --> 02:05:54,089
Hello, Forrest.

1521
02:05:54,757 --> 02:05:57,426
You got new legs. New legs!

1522
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:02,431
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1523
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:07,144
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1524
02:06:10,981 --> 02:06:12,483
Magic legs.

1525
02:06:14,485 --> 02:06:18,864
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1526
02:06:21,658 --> 02:06:25,037
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1527
02:06:27,122 --> 02:06:30,334
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1528
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:33,712
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1529
02:06:43,847 --> 02:06:48,018
MINISTER: Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1530
02:06:49,895 --> 02:06:54,149
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1531
02:06:55,484 --> 02:06:58,862
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1532
02:07:29,726 --> 02:07:31,603
- Hey.
- Hey.

1533
02:07:45,284 --> 02:07:47,077
Hey, Forrest.

1534
02:07:52,416 --> 02:07:54,209
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1535
02:07:55,878 --> 02:07:58,213
Yes. Well, I...

1536
02:07:59,548 --> 02:08:01,258
I don't know.

1537
02:08:01,967 --> 02:08:06,930
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.</i>

1538
02:08:10,058 --> 02:08:12,102
<i>And then it was nice.</i>

1539
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:19,443
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1540
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:24,615
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water.</i>

1541
02:08:26,408 --> 02:08:30,329
<i>Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

1542
02:08:30,454 --> 02:08:35,042
<i>it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.</i>

1543
02:08:37,586 --> 02:08:40,631
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1544
02:08:43,091 --> 02:08:47,262
<i>I couldn't tell where heaven stopped</i>

1545
02:08:47,804 --> 02:08:50,182
<i>and the earth began.</i>

1546
02:08:51,433 --> 02:08:53,310
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

1547
02:08:58,023 --> 02:09:01,109
I wish I could've been there with you.

1548
02:09:04,196 --> 02:09:05,614
You were.

1549
02:09:16,333 --> 02:09:17,793
I love you.

1550
02:09:22,172 --> 02:09:25,509
<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

1551
02:09:27,219 --> 02:09:30,973
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1552
02:09:35,852 --> 02:09:40,691
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1553
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:46,488
<i>Mama</i>

1554
02:09:47,572 --> 02:09:52,577
always said that dying was a part of life.

1555
02:09:55,998 --> 02:09:58,333
I sure wish it wasn't.

1556
02:10:01,003 --> 02:10:04,756
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1557
02:10:06,091 --> 02:10:07,175
But...

1558
02:10:07,426 --> 02:10:10,095
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

1559
02:10:11,930 --> 02:10:15,726
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1560
02:10:17,894 --> 02:10:23,900
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1561
02:10:27,029 --> 02:10:29,614
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1562
02:10:30,907 --> 02:10:31,950
Okay.

1563
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:33,368
<i>He's really good.</i>

1564
02:10:33,452 --> 02:10:35,579
Forrest, you go.

1565
02:10:39,791 --> 02:10:41,376
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

1566
02:10:44,921 --> 02:10:48,383
(SOBBING) And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.

1567
02:10:51,636 --> 02:10:53,889
You'd be so proud of him.

1568
02:10:55,599 --> 02:10:57,059
I am.

1569
02:10:58,101 --> 02:11:01,313
He wrote you a letter.

1570
02:11:02,898 --> 02:11:04,941
And he says I can't read it.

1571
02:11:05,067 --> 02:11:08,612
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1572
02:11:24,669 --> 02:11:26,004
Jenny,

1573
02:11:31,802 --> 02:11:35,013
I don't know if Mama was right,

1574
02:11:36,348 --> 02:11:37,849
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1575
02:11:37,974 --> 02:11:40,560
I don't know

1576
02:11:40,644 --> 02:11:45,148
if we each have a destiny,

1577
02:11:47,192 --> 02:11:52,322
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1578
02:11:56,827 --> 02:11:58,662
But I think

1579
02:12:00,539 --> 02:12:02,332
maybe it's both.

1580
02:12:06,670 --> 02:12:09,548
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1581
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:17,681
But I miss you, Jenny.

1582
02:12:24,062 --> 02:12:28,483
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1583
02:13:03,768 --> 02:13:06,730
Here's your bus. Okay.

1584
02:13:08,398 --> 02:13:11,735
Hey. I know this.

1585
02:13:11,860 --> 02:13:14,738
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1586
02:13:14,863 --> 02:13:17,532
Grandma used to read it to you.

1587
02:13:17,616 --> 02:13:19,743
My favourite book.

1588
02:13:23,079 --> 02:13:24,581
Here we are.

1589
02:13:24,748 --> 02:13:26,208
Okay.

1590
02:13:27,918 --> 02:13:29,419
Here you go.

1591
02:13:34,299 --> 02:13:36,801
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1592
02:13:40,263 --> 02:13:43,975
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1593
02:13:45,977 --> 02:13:48,772
I'll be right here when you get back.

1594
02:13:53,318 --> 02:13:56,571
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1595
02:13:56,655 --> 02:14:00,200
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
